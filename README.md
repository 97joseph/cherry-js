What is this?
-------------

This is a small JS framework I'm coding for fun. It's definately nowhere near production ready (or good) but hopefully one day!

It works in a similar way to AngularJS at the moment with a few differences (and a LOT of exclusions.) If you want to find out how to use it, look at `example/index.html` for an idea and a demo
